# renamer README

I was bored with renaming every file I created in Visual Studio Code.  So I created this so I could rename the files in the same why every time by just running the command.

## Features

Renames the file by lowercasing the file name and replacing the spaces with hyphens.  It's a niche requirement.  I'm not expecting anyone else to really need this, but if you do, then that's cool!  I use Visual Studio Code for note taking and I want the name of the file to be the first line of the content of the file which I use for the title of the document, but I want the title to be title case, and I want the file name to be lowercase with the spaces replaced by hyphens.  Which is what the command this extension has does. 

### Instructions

1. Save your file
2. Look for the command `Renamer` in the command palette and run
3. Use the time you've saved to do something productive, like pick your nose, or scratch your head

## Known Issues

It's more about unknown unknowns at this point.

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1

First release.  Lowercasing and replacing spaces with hyphens is hard coded.  Limited testing done.  I'm sure there will be issues!
